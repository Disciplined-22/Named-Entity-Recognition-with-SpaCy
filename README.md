# SpaCy Named Entity Recognition

This repository demonstrates how to use SpaCy, a popular natural language processing library, for Named Entity Recognition (NER). Named Entity Recognition is a crucial task in NLP that involves identifying and classifying entities, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and more, within a given text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install the required dependencies by running:
  pip install spacy

### Usage
Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/Disciplined-22/Named-Entity-Recognition-with-SpaCy.git
 cd spacy-ner-example

Run the example script:
  python main.py
  This script loads the SpaCy English model (en_core_web_sm) and processes a sample text, extracting and printing named entities along with their labels.
